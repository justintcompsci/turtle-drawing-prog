# turtle-drawing-prog
The Logo computer language made popular a concept of turtle graphics which was popular among personal computer users.   A mechanical turtle walks around a room under the control of a C++ program. Note: There is no animation of the turtle walking around the room.  The turtle holds a pen in one of two positions, up or down.   When the pen is down the turtle draws out the shape as it moves.   When the pen is up, the turtle moves about freely without writing anything.   For this assignment you will write a program to simulate the operation of the turtle thus replicating a computerized drafting board, plotter, and a computerized cutting machine.   Use a n by n array where you determine the size of the array and call the array grid. The array should be initialized to all zeros. The commands to manipulate the “turtle” are input from an external file called turtle.txt.
